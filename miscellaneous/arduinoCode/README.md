Copy this folder to `src/core/` and it will be automatically added to the build system.
The `sample.cpp` file contains the code from an ino file without the include directives. You can write
code in this file like a typical ino file in the Arduino-ide but without any include directives.
The folder is git ignored under `/src/core/` and is provided so that ino files can be compiled with ease.
